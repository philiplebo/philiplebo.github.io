The past week or so has been insane. I’ve hardly had time at all to sit down and write a blog entry, and I’ve actually been dreading doing so because I know I have so much to catch up on. I’m going to try to split up the past week or so into three different entries. It seems neater that way. Also, I’m going to try to write most of it as if it was written as it happened.

Also, someone please give me some feedback on if these entries are too long. I’m trying to be detailed and there is a lot to say, but I feel as if I’m typing far too much.




**First Glimpse**

Judy and I arrived at Singapore’s Changi airport at 1:00 in the morning. Somehow, after all of the mess that was our journey from Dallas, our luggage had arrived with us without a problem. We dragged it out to the curb where a taxi driver quickly waved us down and asked if we needed a ride, so we hopped in. This is when we found out a very essential fact about taxi drivers in Singapore: none of them have any idea where _anything_ is. Because of this, and because of the difficulty translating Singlish (Singapore’s strange version of English) to English, it took more than ten minutes just to explain where our hostel was. We finally settled on just telling him to go to a cross street near our hostel and we would walk from there. Off we went.

And that’s when we got our first glimpse of The Lion City. Cruising through Singapore at 1:00 in the morning was one of the most amazing sights we had seen thus far. It is impossible to explain how many glittering buildings and lights there are, and unfortunately the taxi was going too fast for us to take any decent pictures. The driver gave us a whirlwind tour of city centre, the whole time emphasizing to us that “Singapore safe! Singapore real safe! Singapore beautiful!” True that.

We got to our hostel about 20 minutes later, immediately passing out in our beds. I felt bad because I was banging my luggage around while everyone else in the room was trying to sleep, but oh well.

**The First Few Days**

For those that don’t know exactly what a hostel is, here is a quick rundown: Each room has several beds in it, this one having 8-10 beds per room. Unlike a hotel where you rent a room for yourself, in a hostel you only rent a bed and share the room with everyone else in it. Bathrooms and showers are shared as well. Sounds strange? It kind of was, but hostels are really popular in most places around the world, and they are extremely cheap. We stayed at this particular hostel for $16 a night, breakfast included. It was a very cool experience. Everyone is very friendly, and nearly all the guests are travelers just passing through. As such, everyone has cool stories to tell about their travels and everyone wants to hang out to see the city together.

Judy and I woke up the next day around 7:00 am, probably suffering from a bit of jet lag. We decided to set off and explore Singapore. First stop: a hawker centre.

A hawker centre is basically a giant food court, and there are hundreds of them strewn around Singapore’s web of streets. When you first walk into a hawker centre, the sight and smell is overwhelming. At the hawker centre we went to, there were maybe 30 different food stalls (small, simple counters where someone takes your order and has a delicious hot plate of food in your hands within seconds) with each stall having 9 or 10 different dishes to choose from. There were literally hundreds of choices. We spent awhile trying to decide what to eat, but eventually Judy and I both decided on the most famous of Singaporean dishes: Hainanese Chicken Rice. Steamed chicken, white rice, and cucumbers served with dark soy sauce, chili sauce, and broth. It sounds simple, but when you mix it all together you get one of the best introductions to Singaporean food you can find. Delicious, fast, and cheap. The entire set only cost us $4 SGD (Singaporean dollars) each, or about $3 USD. Food here in general is very inexpensive. You will never end up paying more than $5 SGD for a full meal unless you are deliberately trying to spend money.

This hawker centre is where we also had our first encounter with one of the greatest things about the Singaporean food scene: the juice stall. At every hawker center, food court, or canteen, you will find a juice stall. For $1-2 SGD, a juice stall will take almost any fruit you can imagine and will turn it into an ice cold cup of deliciousness within seconds. Some juice stalls will even serve it with ground ice, making the most delicious slush you can imagine. Mango, lime, lemon, orange, kiwi, strawberry, apple, dragonfruit (my favorite so far), pear, papaya, watermelon, honeydew melon, pineapple, soursop, coconut, and any combination thereof… you name it and they will juice it for you. It’s like having a Jamba Juice inside every restaurant you go to, except the smoothie is ten times cheaper and twenty times better.

Judy and I were supposed to be on campus at 2:00 pm for registration, so we set course for the MRT (mass rapid transit) station after we ate. Now I have to admit that the only public transport systems I’ve ever seen are the pitiful DART and Capital Metro systems in Dallas and Austin, but the public transport system in Singapore is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life. If it was up to me, the trains here would be considered the 8th Wonder of the World. Each train is about a football field long, holds almost 2,000 people (not exaggerating. Just to note: there will probably be many times in my blogging where I will quote very large numbers of people, and you may suspect that they are exaggerated, but I assure you that they are not. There are a **lot** of people here.), and because they are fully computer controlled, they are always on time. The fare system is also one of the most genius things I’ve ever used. You buy a little card that has an RFID chip inside it, and you can use ticketing machines to “top up” or put money on the card. Whenever you enter a train station or board a bus, you swipe your card, and then swipe it again whenever you exit the bus or leave the train station. And instead of paying a flat fee for each bus or train ride, you are charged based on how far you travel. Three kilometers will set you back about 75 cents, while a short ride down the street only costs five cents. It’s a simple, genius system that works better than anything I’ve ever seen or heard of. Actually, that should be the motto of Singapore: simple, genius, and just works.

After a little bit of getting lost, we arrived on campus. Again, it is very hard to explain just what the campus is like. Lots of hills, lots of enormous buildings, and tons of tropical vegetation. Most of the buildings are entirely open air. Even most of the main lobbies and food courts inside the buildings are outside. In fact, most of everything in Singapore is open to the outside, which is actually quite nice once you are acclimated to the humidity.

Side note about the humidity: Holy crap it is humid here. The first day was like trying to breathe water. When you sweat (which you do, a lot) it doesn’t evaporate. After you take a cold shower, which you learn very quickly that cold showers are a gift from God here in Singapore, you don’t dry off, you just sort of get a little less wet. Surprisingly it isn’t that hot, though. Perhaps that is just because I’m used to 100+ degree weather in Texas. 80 degrees is fairly comfortable for me, especially if there is a nice breeze.

Anyway, back to campus. We queued for several hours to complete our formalities and obtain our student pass, the identity card that allows us to live in the country, but we were turned away and told we had to come back on another day. Annoying, but this line is where Judy and I met two very awesome people: Tin (pronounced “Teen”) from Croatia and Alison from Vancouver.

We spent some time getting to know each other, and afterwards ended up at a very random Chinese restaurant on campus. One of the ladies behind the counter shoved some sort of oyster in my face and told me to eat it. I did. It was alright.

The next day Judy and I did a bit more exploring around the city. Nothing big, but eventually we hopped onto the wrong bus, getting us lost in the middle of a neighborhood we had not been to before. After lots of trial and error, several buses later, and a few miles of walking, we ended up back at our hostel. It was actually a fun experience and we got to see a lot of cool sights from around the city.

That night I met a group of travelers hanging out at our hostel. There was an American, a Mexican, a Spaniard, and a local. We went and got a bite to eat from the hawker centre and hung out on a rooftop for a few hours. I really like the atmosphere of hostels. Everyone is friendly, interesting to talk to, and always willing to explore.

The rest of the entries are coming, I promise. There is so much to tell and so little time to write, but I'll get to it.
