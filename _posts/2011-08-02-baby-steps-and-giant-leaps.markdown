First post to the travel blog. I intended to have my first post be some sort of “Singapore 101” so you can have some background on Singapore and the surrounding area, or maybe a “Why I Chose Singapore” post, since that still seems to be a topic of mild interest. I'll probably get around to writing those once I actually get settled into my dorm in Singapore. For now, excessive amounts of time in airport lounges and on flights around the world means that the next few updates will just be tales of navigating the perils of international flights. Unfortunately, I am terrible at remembering to take pictures, so until I get better, there will be a distinct lack of visual aids. And since some of the posts are written while on flights without internet access, they will be posted after-the-fact, despite being written in the present tense.

Also, this first post is really long. Really, really long.

I've been sitting in this same airplane for four hours now. That would be fine, considering I was planning on spending a good thirteen or fourteen hours on a plane over the Pacific anyway. Except in the past four hours I've been here, this plane hasn't moved an inch.

I should have expected this. I don't know why I thought the trip to Singapore would be easy in the slightest. My naivety got the best of me, I suppose. I assumed that I would just hop from plane to plane and be in Singapore within 26 hours. But you know what happens when you assume, ya?

After getting about one hour of sleep, I woke up this morning at 5:30am. On the way to the airport I found out that my first flight of the day, from Dallas to Atlanta, had been delayed by about 20 minutes. 20 minutes isn't that bad, right? It is when your connecting flight to Tokyo is departing only thirty minutes later on the complete opposite end of the airport.

By the time we deplaned we only had fifteen minutes to navigate our way through what seemed like miles of tunnels, escalators, and angry people. We arrived at the gate just as they pulled the jetway back. Too late.

After a painful walk from the departure gate back to the ticket counter (seriously, WHY does Atlanta's airport have so many long, empty hallways?) we spoke to a booking agent. The conversation went something like this:

Me: Hi, we were supposed to be on the flight to Tokyo-Narita, but our connecting flight was delayed and we did not make it.

Agent: Okay.

(awkward pause with prolonged and awkward eye contact)

Agent: I guess we can fix that for you.

Me: That would be wonderful.

(The agent leans over to a coworker next to her and mumbles something. The coworker mumbles something back, stands up, and walks away.)

Agent: Hmm, I dunno... The 28th? No... Tomorrow? No, not gonna happen...

(The coworker comes back, mumbles something to the agent, and disappears again. The agent stops fiddling with her computer and just stares at me.)

Me: Any hope of me getting out of here any time soon?

Agent: Maybe. We're checking on it for you. (blank stare)

Cue another awkward silence. This one lasted so long that I eventually pulled out my phone and started texting people. The agent, perhaps somewhat unsurprisingly, pulled out her cell phone and fiddled with it as well. The other booking agent eventually came back and to tell us that she has found us a flight to New York, to Germany, to Singapore. This flight actually put us arriving at a better time than our previous one, so we were pretty happy.

That flight to New York was supposed to leave at 3:25. Due to bad weather in the northeast, we haven't even left the gate yet. It's 7:20.

And as I type this, major thunderstorms are rolling in to Atlanta. Sigh. We aren't going anywhere.

I'm back on the same plane. We got off once the storms hit because it was obvious we were not going to be departing any time soon. Missed our connection to Germany by a mile. Another booking agent told us we should fly to New York anyway and let the booking agents there figure out how to get us to Singapore, promising that they would put us up in a hotel in New York overnight. I'm skeptical.

Thanks to the storms, there was a major delay in getting to New York. We boarded the plane again at 8:45 (scheduled to board at 8:20 but everything is late today) and didn't actually take off until 10:00ish. Landing in NYC around 12:30am. Wonderful.

So to recap: I left the house this morning at 5:45am, was at the airport by 6:30am, and now, 16 hours later, I haven't even left the United States.

It just occurred to me that I've been typing “we” this entire time without ever clarifying who “we” is. I'm traveling with Judy, a fellow UT student who is also studying abroad in Singapore. Say hi, Judy!

My skepticism was well founded. We arrived at JFK at 12:36am. Seeing as how our flight was delayed six wonderful hours, nearly everyone onboard made a beeline for the nearest gate agent. We weren't the only late flight, either. Several others had just landed or were in the process of pulling up to the gate and mobs of people were crowding ticket counters. To make matters worse, the entire terminal was being serviced by a grand total of two (yes, 2) booking agents who were responsible for rebooking every single person on every single plane that just landed.

Let's get this straight: the entire eastern seaboard experienced several hours worth of delays, every flight into and out of Dulles, JFK, LaGuardia, Philadelphia, and Newark was delayed or canceled. Thousands of people needed to be rebooked, and most of them needed places to stay. And the geniuses at the airline decided that TWO booking agents would be enough to staff one of the busiest airport terminals in the country? You can imagine the general atmosphere of the place. Many, many angry customers, and many (ahem, two...) angry booking agents tired of dealing with angry customers. There were several bouts of shouting across the concourse.

Long story short(er), there was no hotel. We ended up spending the night roaming around the airport, opting to not sleep because we are now booked on a flight from New York to Tokyo, a 15 hour flight where we will hopefully be sleeping most of the way. From Tokyo we are flying to Singapore.

If you've been following closely, you might notice that Tokyo to Singapore was the original flight plan before all of this rebooking and rebooking and rebooking mess. Cute. At least this time we get to fly on a 747. I've always wanted to ride on a 747...

My carry-on bag has been quite the source of suffering and entertainment. It's a duffel bag but for some reason the shoulder strap has been removed, meaning I've been struggling to carry it by two measly handles that have scraped and burned my hands more than I'd like to admit. I decided to buy a luggage strap from one of the airport stores to use as a shoulder strap. First problem: said luggage strap was encased in that stupid, thick plastic that is impossible to open even with a good pair of scissors, and we were trapped inside a building where possession of any sharp objects will get you shipped off to Gitmo.

After half an hour of pulling, ripping, slamming, biting, and futile attempts to stab the plastic with a pen, we somehow got it open. Second problem: the strap was about three times too big to fit inside the shoulder strap loops on my duffel bag. I had the genius idea to wrap the strap around the bag...

Judy found a way to make it work, and I got an awesome looking chest strap to match. (This whole ordeal was much more hilarious than it should have been thanks to sleep deprivation-induced delirium.)

It is... I don't even know what time it is right now. I think it's like 1 AM or something like that in Texas. We left New York around 2 PM and and flew west over Canada, Alaska, and the Pacific Ocean to Japan. I lost track of time several hours ago because the sun has been bombarding the plane nonstop since we took off.

Random aside: Boeing 747s are awesome. They're so huge! It's crazy thinking that something as big as an apartment complex can soar through the air at 600 mph.

I've ran out of things to do on this airplane. I've slept for several hours, read an entire book (I'm saving the other book I have for my 7 hour connecting flight after this one), watched several movies, (who's dumb idea was it to choose “Jane Eyre” as one of the in-flight movies? And “Big Momma”? On a flight to Japan? Really?) and slept for a few more hours. I think I’m going to go back to sleep right now.

I’m on the plane from Tokyo to Singapore now, it looks like we are actually going to make it! We had a few hours to kill in the airport so Judy and I went to a few shops. There are a lot of really cool knick-knacks to buy. We will definitely have to buy a few things on our way back stateside. We also got some real Japanese ramen, which was delicious. It set us back about $10 USD, though. Everything in Japan appears to be pretty expensive. We were a little disappointed because we flew into Tokyo-Narita airport rather than Haneda, which means we were too far away from downtown Tokyo to see any of the city proper. Next time, perhaps.

For now, Singapore or bust.
