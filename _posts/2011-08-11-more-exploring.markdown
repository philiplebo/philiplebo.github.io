The rest of the week was extremely busy. From shopping, going out, exploring more of the city, and dealing with course registration, there was hardly any free time to be had. And the small amounts of free time that did pop up here and there were occupied by much needed rest.

On more than one occasion my group of friends and I have found ourselves in restaurants where the staff have been slightly overzealous to cater to a group of foreigners. Nearly every local we have run into has gone out of their way to help us in any way possible. In one particular restaurant, the manager came to our table and hovered above us the entire time we were eating. He told us funny stories about Singapore and made sure that every bite we took was the best thing we had ever tasted. It was a weird experience, but he treated us like royalty. The food was delicious, too, and even though the restaurant was fancier than the places we had previously been eating at, it was still only $6 SGD per person.

Wednesday night is Ladies’ Night in Singapore, which means that all bars, clubs, and pubs have free entrance and free drinks for all women. We (“we” being a huge group of international students) decided we were going to check out the nightlife of Singapore, but first we had to go to the mall and get some nicer clothes. For some reason, I only packed two shirts worthy of being worn on a night out, and one of them is a plaid country shirt. I realized once I pulled it out of my luggage that it would be completely useless to me for the next four months.

We stopped by VivoCity, a huge mall near the waterfront, to see if we could find anything good. All we found were insane prices. Don’t get me wrong, there were some nice clothes and the mall had pretty much any store you could ever think of, but $140 for a Banana Republic polo? Blah. We decided to go back to Clementi Mall where we found slightly cheaper prices. Clementi always seems to be the best place to go.

**The American Top 40**

Anyway, back to ladies’ night. The nightlife in Singapore is crazy. At first, everything was just like a normal night out on the town, but once we started dancing things got a little insane. Locals were crowding around us just to watch us dance, and one group of local girls kept insisting on taking pictures with me and Tin. We’re just so darn irresistible.

I’ve known for a long time that Singapore is considered to be very westernized compared to other countries in Asia, but I had assumed that there would still be some sort of local music scene around here. There isn’t. Every single song we heard was straight from the American Top 40 playlist, and most of them were songs that were popular several years ago. Since I’ve been here, I’ve heard more U2, Britney Spears, Adele, and Bruno Mars than I ever wanted to hear in my entire life. And for the love of music, if I hear one more Asian cover of Taylor Swift’s “Mean”, I will throw someone through a wall.

The club we were at had a house band that was surprisingly very good, although all of their songs were American covers. I still find it strange that their biggest hit was “Dani California”, but at least it sounded alright. They also played Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’”, which appears to be just as popular here as anywhere else.

**Speed Bumps**

The next two days were dedicated to course registration and planning a weekend trip. Course registration here is the most stressful thing I think I have ever had to deal with. It’s even worse than the system at UT, which I’ve always regarded as the most stressful thing about college.




At the beginning of course registration, you submit a list of courses you would like to take. After requesting a course, you have to sit and wait for the departments to get back to you and let you know if you were approved to take the course or not. This approval process can take a week or more. Right now, 11 days after requesting approval for three classes, I’m still waiting for the results.

But that is not the worst part of it, oh no. Once you are approved for a course, the system randomly assigns you the time which you will be attending the class. There is no way to choose it yourself. Better yet, the system doesn’t take into consideration time conflicts when assigning you courses, so you might be assigned two courses that meet at exactly the same time. The only way to fix this is to drop one of the courses and request it again, hoping to get lucky with a different time assignment the second time around. Wonderful.

I spent the better part of last Thursday, as well as a few days this week, in and out of offices speaking with advisors and course coordinators. At first they were all the most useless people I have ever dealt with, but that changed pretty quickly once I stopped being the reserved, polite, and kind student that I usually am and turned into the typical loud, angry American. I really am ashamed to admit that, but it seems to be the only thing that works here.

On Friday we went to the U.S. Embassy to clear up a few random questions we had about visas and traveling. I didn’t exactly expect to be treated like the prodigal son returning to American soil or anything, but geez, they acted like we were felons being processed before being put into lockup.

We got lost on our way back from the embassy and ended up at another random mall (I swear there is a shopping mall on every street corner here) and started looking for something to eat. Now by this point we had all been in Singapore for over a week and although we all love S’porean cuisine, several nights of drooling over all of the dishes from our respective home countries had us all missing some good ol’ western food. We stumbled across a food stand simply labeled “BBQ” where Zack and I spotted some corn dogs and barbecued chicken. We couldn’t resist.

We also ended up walking through a random street market on our way back. Tons and tons of random stuff. We saw one guy that sold nothing but old television remotes, although there were several others that sold typical street vendor stuff like watches, cell phones, or old laptops. I might need to go back to buy some cheap trinkets and souvenirs.

Before going home, we needed to go the bus station to see if there were any seats available on a bus to Malaysia, as we wanted to get out of Singapore for the weekend and go to Pulau Tioman, a small secluded island. Tin already had arranged to go to Tioman with a group of about 50 other exchange students. Unfortunately there wasn’t any room left on their bus for the rest of our group, so we had to get there some other way.  After several hours of looking for the bus station (we have become really good at getting lost in Singapore) we gave up and I called one of my local friends. It took him about five seconds to give me a phone number to call to check ticket availability. Next time, I’m calling him first.

There weren’t any tickets available, and after such a long day of walking around the scorching hot city, we resigned to the fact that we were not going to Tioman.

**Blowing Bubbles**

Even though it was Friday night, we were all exhausted and decided to relax on the lawn in front of our dorms. Judy busted out a bottle of bubbles and started blowing them everywhere. You would think that the people here have never seen bubbles before, as several people ran up to us in utter amazement of our floating soap spheres, demanding to know what they were and where we got them. Then again, someone probably thought the same thing about us. We ran around the field for an hour chasing the bubbles like little children. I think it was just what everyone needed to cheer up a bit after a long, hot day.

And then, at 1:00am Saturday morning after just enough cheering up, we made the final decision that we were, in fact, going to Tioman for the weekend. Nothing was going to stop us.
