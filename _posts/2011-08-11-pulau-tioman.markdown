We woke up at 4:00am (yes, four in the morning) to begin our journey to Malaysia. Unfortunately, Zack, Will, and Wonchi had previous obligations and could not go with us. It was just me, Judy, Alison, and Kelly. Honestly, I was a little wary of trekking through the forests of Malaysia with just me and three girls, but I wasn't going to let that stop us from going.

We took a taxi from UTown to a bus station from where we had heard a bus departs for Johor Bahru, the city immediately on the other side of the Singapore-Malaysia border. The bus ride was uneventful until we got the border, at which point we had to get off the bus and go through Singapore’s immigration checkpoint, get back on the bus, drive across the bridge connecting the two countries, get off the bus again, and go through Malaysia’s checkpoint. It took about an hour and a half, much longer than we had hoped, but it still wasn’t a big deal. We eventually got to the bus station in Johor Bahru. This is the point from where we were pretty much improvising the rest of our trip. We had heard that you could get buses from here to Mersing, the city nearest to Pulau Tioman, but we weren’t sure. We walked around for half an hour before we found a bus company with open seats to Mersing, but our bus still didn’t leave until 8:00.

We stopped by a bread shop at the station to get some cheap breakfast. We walked around the bus station a bit, too. It was slightly creepy because it was so early in the morning and most of the places were still dark. We stumbled across a KFC, a McDonald’s, a Pizza Hut, Dunkin’ Donuts, Long John Silver’s, and a Popeye’s. It’s weird, because apparently Pizza Hut and KFC are almost regarded as delicacies here in Asia. Instead of going in, buying a pizza or some fried chicken, and leaving, they are sit-down restaurants where you are served by wait staff.

Once we got on the bus, we slept almost the whole way from Johor Bahru to Mersing. The ride was about three hours long. I woke up every so often to snap a few pictures of the Malaysian countryside, which was beautiful. It really was like driving through the rainforest.

After we got to Mersing, we had to wait several hours to board the ferry to Pulau Tioman. As the ferry ride was also about two hours long, we slept most of the way on it, too. Arriving at Tioman was like nothing I’ve ever experienced before. I don’t know what I was expecting, but whatever it was, I did not expect to find the mountainous tropical island that I was now standing on.

The ferry dropped us off on the west side of the island at the village of Tekek. We needed to be on the east side, as that is where we were supposed to meet up with the other exchange students that were staying nearby. Not long after we got off the ferry, a taxi driver approached us and offered us a ride to Juara, the village on the east coast. We accepted before we realized that his taxi was actually a 4x4 pickup truck with only room for one of us in the cab. We were going to have to ride in the truck bed. We thought it looked fun, so we hopped in.

To get from Tekek to Juara we had to climb a tiny road up one side of a mountain, and then slowly descend the other side. The ride took about half an hour, and the entire time I felt like I was driving through Jurassic Park. We were in the middle of the jungle, with nothing but trees and wildlife around us for miles. It was amazing.

I think we all had expected Juara to be somewhat touristy, with a good bit of people running around on the beach. We were wrong. Other than the few locals running the small resorts on the beach, we were the only people there. We practically had the entire beach to ourselves. The beaches, by the way, were gorgeous. I haven’t been to very many beaches in my life but when I think of an island paradise, its beaches don’t even compare to Tioman’s. It wasn’t long before we were in the water.

After awhile we met up with Tin and the rest of the exchange students that were on the island. We had a blast playing sand volleyball and swimming through the waves. A local walked out onto the beach with two pet monkeys, so we all crowded around to take a look. They were cute, funny, and even knew how to swim through the ocean. It looked a little strange to me that they were on chain leashes, though.

The rest of the day is kind of a blur. We did more typical beach stuff. We wanted to try surfing or maybe snorkeling, but unfortunately we didn’t really have time for it. The other students had planned to have a barbecue and throw a big party on the beach that night, so we joined them and had a good time. Like everywhere in Southeast Asia, there was a lot of good food. I tried calamari for the first time. It was pretty tasty. A tropical rainstorm blew in sometime in the middle of the party, so we all took shelter inside a small resort on the beach.

Speaking of resorts, when I say “resort” I don’t mean a five-star hotel on the beach. The Tioman version of a resort is a small shack with several smaller shacks around it. The main shack has a small bar, a lounge, and a small office. Each smaller shack houses a single bed and a small bathroom. Originally, we were going to camp on the beach in a tent, but once it started raining we found a shack instead. It was definitely a smart choice.

Unfortunately, because I had to be back on campus by Monday to finish course registration stuff, we had to leave the next day around noon. We woke up early and spent a few more hours on the beach before beginning our journey back to Singapore. The return trip was pretty much the same as the trip there, except during daytime instead of early in the morning. People in Malaysia are extremely helpful, and we concluded that everyone wants to try their hardest to get you where you need to go, they just hope that they can get some money out of you. As long as you are aware of what fair prices are for bus and taxi rides and don’t let them sucker you into paying extra, traveling through Malaysia is wonderful.

I do hope that we can come back to this part of Malaysia when we have more time. Our trip was cut a little short, and we didn’t get to do much sightseeing. While passing through towns like Kota Tinggi and even Johor Bahru, I found myself wishing that I had a few days to wander through the city and get to know the locals. Maybe next weekend.
