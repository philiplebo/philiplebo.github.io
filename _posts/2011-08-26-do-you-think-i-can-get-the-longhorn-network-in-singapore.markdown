There are a lot of things I should be doing right now instead of blogging. Packing, studying, writing thank you letters to scholarship donors, laundry… but I digress. I want to blog. The problem is, I don’t really know what to blog about. There hasn’t been a whole lot going on this week. Last week was mostly full of me going in and out of department offices begging people to give me classes. It all worked out in the end, but most of the stuff I did isn’t worth blogging about. So instead I’m just going to type and see what comes out.

Last weekend I met this Singaporean named George. A few years ago, George decided that he wanted to move to America to pursue his studies, and he moved to Austin, Texas to attend UT. When he heard that several of us from UT were kicking it in Singapore, he decided to take all of us Longhorns out for a night on the town.

When I came to Singapore, I only knew of 5 Longhorns that would be here at the same time I was: three on exchange from the business school and two locals that I met while they were on exchange at UT last semester. It turns out there are more than 15 of us, six of which are UT students currently on exchange in Singapore, the rest of which are locals that have studied at UT in the past. It was so cool to meet all of them. I guess back home I’ve never actually considered UT as a big internationally renowned university, but it is. I’ve had many people light up and tell me how smart I must be because I go to The University of Texas. It’s awesome. Who doesn’t like to hear it when their school (and their self) is praised?

Anyway, meeting up with all of those Longhorns was a blast. Here I am, thousands and thousands of miles from home, and I run into a huge group of people that just last semester were probably eating at tables only feet away from me in Austin. I’ve always heard about the “McCombs Network” (or whatever they call it) that spans the globe, but I’ve always disregarded it as a marketing gimmick. It’s true though, and it’s awesome. Today I actually saw another person wearing a UT shirt and it made me all giddy. Back home, even when not in Austin, seeing a UT shirt means nothing because everyone and their mother is a Longhorn fan. But seeing that distinct burnt orange hue here is like some instant bond. It’s weird, and it’s hard to explain, but it’s cool. It’s really, really cool.

The next day, George took us out for lunch at dim sum restaurant at the top of one of the tallest buildings in Singapore. That was amazing. The food was great, the view was stunning, and again, it was awesome to meet more fellow Longhorns. After lunch we toured downtown a little bit. We saw the Marina Bay Sands Casino and even went up to the skypark at the top (it’s a huge park and swimming pool on a platform held up by three skyscrapers). Unfortunately we couldn’t really get any good pictures of the view because of a private event being held.

We also went to 1-Altitude, a lounge on the roof of the tallest (or second tallest, Wikipedia isn’t sure) skyscraper in Singapore. Now **that** was a view. We hung out on the roof for awhile and watched the sun set before grabbing dinner.

I had to say my goodbyes to George and a few of the other Longhorns after dinner because they were heading on a backpacking trip through Indonesia before flying back to Texas for school. It was a weird goodbye, knowing that they were going back to my home while I was staying here in theirs, but it was nice to know that when I return home, we’ll have the chance to meet back up.

I can’t really stress enough how amazing it is to meet people here, halfway across the world, and know that we will remain friends even when I’m back home. Like I said in my last entry, the people here are what make this entire experience so amazing.

Classes are interesting. Chinese continues to be a lot of fun despite being a lot of work. We’re moving extremely fast, which I really like. One of the main reasons I wanted to study abroad is because it would be a great way to learn a new language (which makes it a little strange that I picked an English speaking country to study in). Hopefully by the end of this semester I’ll be able to hold a conversation in Chinese. And who knows, maybe I’ll pick up some other languages from the other exchange students here as well. I’ve already gotten some Russian girls to teach me some Russian phrases!

It’s hard to explain how many times my class schedule has actually changed. I spent several weeks meeting with several departments and professors trying to get approval to take classes I needed/wanted. It was a headache that I’m not going to go into detail about. As of now, I’m taking Chinese, Finance, and a class about the business environment in Southeast Asia. I’m actually supposed to be in four classes, but I got approval from McCombs to only take three classes because Chinese is more than twice the workload of a normal course. It’s cool, but I honestly feel like an underachiever when people say they have four or five classes and I have a measly three.

I had the strangest experience with some local students last week. It was the first (and so far, the only) time I have felt unwelcome as an exchange student in Singapore. I walked into one of my classes to find that the only other people that had arrived yet were another exchange student, and one local student. The local student questioned why and how we exchange students were in this particular class, saying there was no way we had the prerequisite to take the class and that it was a “locals-only course.” Strange, but easy to ignore for now.

The class turned out to only have 23 students in it, of which 9 were on exchange. As far as I know, it’s really unusual for the classes here to have such a high proportion of exchange students, so it was understandable that the local students were a little on edge. I didn’t expect what came next, though. The professor asked the class what we thought were the strengths, weaknesses, etc of the university. One of the locals raised his hand and said “I think there are far too many exchange students here.”

Whoa. Immediate tension.

The professor’s attempt to quell the tension did pretty much the opposite. “Well, uh, I guess I can understand that. Many Singaporeans feel that there are too many foreigners here.” Uhhh, okay.

It didn’t end there. This was a course that required us to form groups for a big group presentation (honestly, what business class these days _doesn’t_ require a group presentation?) and when the professor asked us to form groups, the local students would not come anywhere near the exchange students. Even when asked to diversify the groups to make sure that some groups were not 100% exchange or local students, the groups didn’t mix.

The entire experience was absolutely bizarre for me. Every other interaction I have had with locals has been amazing, and they are always ecstatic to get to know me and I am always eager to get to know them. There was just something about this particular class that made everyone hostile. I don’t know what it was.

I went on a night safari a few nights ago. I saw lions, tigers, leopards, bats, hippos, rhinos, giraffes, monkeys, boars... lots of stuff. There was no fence between me and them (!!!). It was hard to get pictures because it was at night, though. There was also a performance by fire-breathers/eaters. That was really cool.

My cell phone is all kinds of messed up. I don’t know if the humidity fried some circuits or if an accidental fall down a staircase did it (don't ask), but my touchscreen sometimes decides to just not work. The left click button on my laptop also broke this week. I’ve needed a new laptop anyway, so I began looking for a new one. I’ve always heard that electronics are cheaper in Asia, so I was eager to find out what kind of deals I could get here.

Deals? Yeah right. The same laptop that would cost me $700 to buy in the U.S. and have shipped to me costs almost $1600 in Singapore. And that’s an “on sale” price. Hopefully when I go to Taiwan or Bangkok I can find some better deals.

I got a haircut today. Terrible, terrible idea. The guy (barber? Hair stylist? I don’t know what to call him) had absolutely no idea what he was doing. I think it was a combination of him just being a terrible barber and the fact that he had probably never touched hair as coarse as mine before. My hair was uneven all over the place and just looked terrible. I ended up borrowing my friend’s hair trimmer and buzzed my head. I hate buzzing my head, but it looks better now than it did a few hours ago… sort of.

It’s my mom’s birthday today. Happy birthday, Mom, I love you! I’d send you a postcard or something but I have no idea how the postal system here works.

And good luck to everyone back home starting school today! It's about time you lazy bums got to work.

Last night I went to a party on the helipad of a skyscraper. Yes, a helipad, 230 meters high, with nothing between me and the sky. It was awesome.

I’m going back to Malaysia this weekend (actually I’m leaving in 50 minutes… I really need to get off the computer. This time I’m going to Malacca, a city sometimes called the cultural capital of Malaysia. It should be a great opportunity to experience some of the culture of Malaysia that I wasn’t able to see on the Tioman trip.

On another note, do you think I can get the Longhorn Network in Singapore? Serious question. I need my football.
