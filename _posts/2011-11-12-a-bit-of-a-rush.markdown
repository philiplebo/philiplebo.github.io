It’s been over a month since my trip to Indonesia, and my last blog post was just wrapping that trip up. That means I have a lot of catching up to do. A lot has happened in the past month, but for brevity’s sake, I’m just going to skim over most of it.

The week or so after we got back from Indonesia was used by pretty much everyone to catch up on school. I had actually planned to start traveling a lot more often after recess week. Because I haven’t had class on Mondays or Fridays this entire semester, I had plenty of time every weekend to travel. Unfortunately, the intensity of my schoolwork really picked up in the second half of the semester and I didn’t really get to travel at all.

A few weeks later, though, I did get the chance to escape to Malaysia for a third time, this time to Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur. Some of you may know KL as the home of the Petronas Twin Towers, two enormous skyscrapers that used to be the tallest buildings in the world. My KL trip was another one of those spur-of-the-moment things where I didn’t actually make the decision to go until a few hours prior to leaving Singapore. At around 7:00pm on a Friday night, four of us decided we were going to hop on an overnight bus to KL and spend a day there.

The trip there was relatively uneventful. We took a bus to Johor Bahru, like we had done several times before, and from there we caught a bus to KL. We arrived in KL around 4:00am at one of the largest and nicest bus stations I’ve ever seen. It was the size of an airport and was ultra fancy and modern looking.

Because KL’s metro rail system doesn’t start operating until 6:00am, we found a secluded corner in the bus station and slept for a few hours. Once the trains started running, we decided that our first stop would be the Batu Caves. The Batu Caves are a series of caverns filled with Hindu temples and various types of wildlife. The main cave is accessible only by climbing an enormous staircase, but the climb was worth it. The cave was enormous and, like many places in Southeast Asia, monkeys were crawling around everywhere. We joked that when at home, you might go somewhere with the sole purpose of seeing monkeys, but here, monkeys are nothing more than a side-attraction.

After the Batu Caves we returned to downtown KL to explore a little bit. We went to the Islamic Art Museum, which was very cool. I especially loved the models of the world’s most prominent mosques (I do love my architecture). We also went to the national mosque of Malaysia. Again, very cool to see, and the people there were some of the nicest and most welcoming I’ve ever met.

We ended up spending a large portion of the day walking around Little India. Deepavali was just a few days away, so there was a huge celebration going on in Little India which meant that squeezing through the narrow walkways and shops was both fun and tiring. After a delicious meal at an Indian restaurant, we got our second wind and were ready to continue our adventure.

After a few more hours wandering around Little India, we made our way to the Petronas Towers just as it was getting dark. The towers are enormous. I’ve never been to a city like New York City or Chicago, so the Petronas Towers are by far the tallest buildings I’ve ever seen. Again, the geeky architecture and engineering nerd in me absolutely loved just sitting at the base of the towers while looking up at them in amazement.

After the towers, it was time for our extremely short KL trip to come to an end. We headed back to the bus station, and after a mix up that almost caused us to miss our bus, we were on our way back to Singapore. I sleepily arrived back at my apartment around 7:00am. It was a short, whirlwind tour of Kuala Lumpur, and I wish I had spent more time in the city, but it was still awesome.

This past week was the last week of classes here in Singapore. It’s a very weird, surreal feeling. It feels like this semester has just flown by, and it still hasn’t fully hit me that in just a few short weeks I have to say goodbye to this wonderful city. I’ve already had to start saying goodbye to a few of my friends. One of my roommates left to go on a two-month trek through Vietnam and Cambodia last week, and because of our different travel schedules, it’s unlikely that I will ever see him again.

My flight back to Texas is in only 40 days. It seems like both a long time and a really short time away. Part of me can’t wait to get back home, but another part is dreading leaving here. There’s still so much that I want to see and do.

In about nine hours I’m leaving for a six day trip to southern Thailand. We’re planning on going to a national park, the beautiful island of Ko Phi Phi, and the resort island Phuket. It should be a lot of fun, but I’m not getting back until the 19th. Seeing as how my first final exam is on the 22nd and I have yet to begin studying for it, I’m going to have to go into major study mode as soon as I land back in Singapore.
