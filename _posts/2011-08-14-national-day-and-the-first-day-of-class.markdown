This past Tuesday was Singapore National Day. National Day, a celebration of Singapore’s independence from Malaysia, is one of Singapore’s biggest holidays. The entire city comes together at Marina Bay to watch an enormous parade, dances, and one of the most magnificent fireworks displays in the world. In addition to the National Day festivities, this past Tuesday was also Rag & Flag day, the day when all of the faculties from the university come together to promote charity by performing dances and constructing floats.

The actual event consists of two parts: Rag, which is a day when club members fill the streets of Singapore asking for donations for various charities, and Flag, a series of performances and dances. The event is also a competition, with the best performing group receiving first place. Over the course of the past several weeks, I have been seeing many of the practice performances and groups working late into the night to prepare their floats, but I still didn’t expect to see the amount of preparation and dedication that was shown during the real performances.

On Tuesday morning we met up near our residences to catch a shuttle bus down to Marina Bay (the waterfront near downtown where all of the festivities were occurring). As soon as we got off the bus we were ushered into a small field where temporary grandstands and a large stage had been erected. Directly in front of us was the bay, and across the bay was The Float. The Float is a very interesting structure to me. Because good real estate around the bay is scarce, the city planners decided to construct something similar to a stadium floating in the bay. The grandstands are built on dry land, facing the water, while an enormous floating platform sits in the water only meters away. The Float is where all of the main National Day events were happening. The seating area gave us a beautiful view of the bay, the central business district, the Marina Bay Sands, the Flyer, and the waterfront.

We managed to grab some fantastic seats because we were a little early, but being early also meant we had to sit and wait awhile for the performances to start. The sun was brutal, but we all brought umbrellas and huddled inside our own bubble of shade. While we were waiting, a random group of students came on stage and started singing some slow rock songs. I don’t think they were part of the planned performances, and they weren’t that great, but at least they were a little distracting from the heat and humidity.

The performances were amazing. There were at least 20 different groups that performed, and each one was so different from the other that it is difficult to describe what they were like. I managed to grab a few pictures, but they don’t really capture how great the dances all were. Most of them incorporated storylines about the battle between good and evil or a love story. The performance from the School of Design and Environment, for example, was about the industrialization of Singapore and environmental pollution. Each performance included a dance that ranged from five to fifteen minutes long, and a parade float that was wheeled onto the stage and used as a prop for each dance. Some of the dance crews were as large as 50+ people, making the performances that much more impressive. It was clear that not only did these students care a lot about making Flag a roaring success, but they also spent a large part of the past month preparing.

The floats were just as impressive as the dances. Each float was built on top of a pickup truck and had to be driven into the event one at a time. They all were elaborately decorated and some of them even included machines that moved individual parts of the float. One float in particular had a giant mechanical spider that began moving in the middle of a performance, causing uproar in the crowd.

After Flag, we stayed seated in the grandstands so that we could watch the National Day events. The stage at Flag also had a giant television screen that was showing the telecast of the National Day Parade. Situated right on the edge of the bay, our seats also gave us some of the best seats possible to see the fireworks.

The parade was fantastic, although it was a little strange to me because of the emphasis put on military power. Even in America, where we have one of the strongest military forces in the world, we don’t celebrate July 4th by rolling tanks down Pennsylvania Avenue. They’re very proud of their military in Singapore, though. They’re proud about everything, actually, and they should be. The island of Singapore was little more than a third-world country only 60 years ago. Singapore has turned into one of the world’s largest financial and industrial centers in less than one generation. Many people here personally witnessed the transition from rags to riches, making the atmosphere of the event that much more electrifying.

The parade began with a showcase of military technology. We were sitting in a prime position to watch Seahawk, Chinook, and Apache helicopters fly overheard, and several Singaporean Navy vessels zipped past us in the bay. On The Float, tanks and armed troops were marching for the crowd. During the entire showcase, a video performance was playing on the television screens. It was a bizarre video of a young buy dreaming of being a military commander during a series of threats to Singaporean shores. But being a complete nerd about helicopters and airplanes, I was totally digging it.

The showcase ended with a Chinook pulling an enormous Singaporean flag through the sky while the national anthem played in the background. The anthem, titled “Majulah Singapura!” (Malay for “Onward, Singapore!” was beautiful. Fun fact about it, though: it is illegal to sing the anthem in any language other than Malay.

After the anthem there was a live performance celebrating Singapore’s lightning-fast rise to power. It included a lot of narratives about Singapore’s history and was incredibly interesting to watch. Some of the performances were a little strange, though, with things like people dressed up as milk cartons dancing on the stage. Again, however, it was clear that a lot of preparation and dedication went into these performances. It reminded me a lot of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.

After the performances ended it was finally dark enough for the fireworks. Holy crap the fireworks. If you know anything about me you probably know that I am an absolute sucker for fireworks, and these were by far the best I have ever seen in my entire life. The fireworks were launched from a barge floating in the middle of the bay, putting us extremely close and giving us a view that just couldn’t be beat. I wish I could have gotten some better pictures, but taking pictures of fireworks is difficult and I was a little too busy gawking at the pretty colors to waste time taking pictures. Some of the fireworks were even launched from the top of the skyscrapers nearby. The show was just incredible.

**First Day of Class**

The first day of class was really uneventful, but I feel like I need to blog about it anyway. So far I’ve only had two of my classes, Finance and Chinese.

Finance was good, but nothing special. I’m not sure, but I think my professor is a guest professor from Pennsylvania’s Wharton school. If so, it should be really cool being taught by someone of such stature. I was slightly surprised because I expected all of the local students to be very focused and taking a lot of notes, but instead the class seemed a lot like a class back home would be like.

My Chinese course was completely different. The professor was literally jumping up and down around the room while instructing us to repeat Chinese phrases. At some points it sounded like we were in choir class rather than learning another language. If it continues this way, Chinese should actually be a lot of fun to learn. And I can already say a few phrases! 你好!
