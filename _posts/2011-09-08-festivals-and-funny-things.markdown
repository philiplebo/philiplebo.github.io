I feel like I’ve been pretty lame the past week or so. I’ve spent far too much time in the lounge studying. And by studying I mean enjoying the air conditioning and couches while on Facebook. According to Tin, what Americans refer to as “studying” is called “learning” in Europe. I don’t quite know if what usually happens in the library can justifiably be called learning, so I’m going to stick with studying.

Last Tuesday was Hari Raya Puasa, a national holiday celebrating the end of Ramadan. Throughout all of Ramadan, there have been night markets set up all over Singapore that are open until the wee hours of the morning serving food and selling almost anything you can imagine. I got the opportunity to head down to the biggest market and check it out on Monday.

Monday was one of the last nights the market was being held, so it was completely packed. I really don’t know if I’ve ever seen more people stuffed into one place. The “market” consisted of several football fields worth of tents and booths. The main road was bathed in flashing lights and every tree visible was draped with even more. Each massive tent housed plenty of food vendors, many stores selling things like clothes, electronics, bed sheets, mattresses, flowers, toys… you name it and they had it. People stood on top of tables with megaphones to shout advertisements in your ear. The entire market was a blur of sights, smells, and deafening sounds. The most interesting part was the food, though.

The food vendors set themselves up behind massive counters in the center and at the edges of the tents. To accommodate the incredible number of people, each counter was completely covered in mountains of all kinds of food. It was impressive.

And it was hot. The heat from the sheer amount of people and the constantly-running cooking appliances was almost unbearable. Smoke from the cooking filled the air, and because it was mostly inside a tent, it didn’t escape. The air was hazy, hot, and hard to breathe. It didn’t help that at any given moment you were touching at least three other people because of how packed the place was. Everyone was sweating and it showed. It was worth it, though. We feasted.

Fried bananas, Ramly burgers, fried and roasted chicken, corn, kebabs, and plenty of other things that I don’t even know the names of (more of the “what is this? No idea, but it’s delicious” type of stuff), we had it all. I also stopped by a Turkish ice cream vendor. The ice cream was terrible, but the show that came along with it was worth it. Turkish ice cream vendors are somewhat famous for playing tricks on customers, pretending to drop the cone or smear the ice cream over your shirt as they hand it to you. It was amusing enough to stop and watch for awhile, but I couldn’t really get any pictures because of how fast the guy was moving. He just showed up as a big Turkish blur in all of the photos I snapped.

We wandered around the market for awhile before we decided we couldn’t handle the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds anymore. It was quite an experience.

There has been a troubling development in my past few weeks here. I’ve picked up quite a bad habit. You might even call it an addiction. A life threatening, disgusting addiction. But I’m in a foreign country and I’m supposed to be trying new things, so can you really blame me if I make some bad decisions while here? I just can’t help but indulge myself.

With McDonald’s.

Seriously, I never even touch McDonald’s when I’m in The States. I pretty much avoid it like it’s the plague, actually. But here, when you’re tired of eating rice (and trust me, you get tired of eating rice) or it’s 3 in the morning and nothing else is open, McDonald’s is where the magic happens. It doesn’t help that they deliver 24/7 (the delivery guy has this awesome motorcycle with a giant burger-stuffed backpack riding shotgun). I’m ashamed to admit that in the past 10 days, I have eaten at McDonald’s six times. This is unacceptable, and I must stop. But the double cheeseburgers are just so good…

Did I really just say that a McDonald’s cheeseburger is good? This is what happens when you’re away from decent burger places for too long. Somebody save me. Does Whataburger ship internationally?

This past week I finally planned out and booked one of the bigger trips I will be taking this semester. During the middle of September, everyone gets an entire week off of school. As you can imagine, every exchange student on the island is planning to spend the entire week somewhere that is decidedly not Singapore. Most choose places like Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, or the famed beaches of Bali. I’m going to Bali too, actually.

But first, I’m going to climb a volcano. And before that I’m going to tour some 1300 year old temple ruins. And then, after backpacking across the Indonesian island of Java, I’m going to spend a few days relaxing on what are often called the nicest beaches in the world. I can’t wait.

I’m pretty happy because after several hours of research, I actually planned this entire trip on my own. I looked on a few travel guides sites, read a few pages of some guide books, and got some advice from friends, but this isn’t an organized tour-guided trip or anything like that. And through a lot of searching, I got flights for much cheaper than several others. I originally had planned the trip for six of us, but since people started hearing that we are going to be climbing an active volcano (!!!) we’ve picked up several others that want to join us. I don’t mean to brag, but I feel pretty awesome about this one.

There’s still a strong possibility that the whole trip could shatter into pieces being dragged through a gutter filled with lava, but hey, that’s what makes traveling fun, right?

On Friday the university had put together some type of concert thing on the green in front of my residence. Many laughs were had at the flyers and banners for the event which read "Wanna know how it feels like to party and have a picnic at the same time, like the ROCK FESTIVALS in Europe?" Oh dear.

Laughs aside, what this really meant for me was that I didn't get much sleep the few days leading up to the concert because of rehearsals and sound checks going on right outside my window. Trying to nap while covers of Bon Jovi and Journey play is impossible (both because it sounded horrible and because you just can't help but put down everything and jam when Journey comes on).

Thanks to the holiday, I had one of my classes rescheduled to Saturday afternoon. I missed out on several events so I could go to this class. It was a complete and utter waste of my time, and I wasn’t too happy about it. Sunday, however, I got the chance to go to a kite festival down near the bay. It was pretty much what it sounds like: lots of people flying lots of kites. The weather was great, the kites were fun to watch, and the atmosphere was really relaxing.

We topped off Sunday by going back to the beach on Sentosa. We goofed off in the ocean a tiny bit, relaxed on the beach, and played some sand volleyball with a group of locals. Sunday was just filled to the brim with relaxing.

[caption id="attachment_190" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Sentosa at sunset"][![](http://philiplebo.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_2496.jpg?w=300)](http://philiplebo.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_2496.jpg)[/caption]

There was an event today for local students interested in studying abroad. I decided to head down to it to see if there were any S'poreans interested in Texas that I could talk to. Unfortunately I had class during the main part of the event, so I was late and there were no future Longhorns around. I was able to speak to the business exchange coordinator, though, and she said she will pass my contact information along to the local students scheduled to be abroad at UT next semester. We'll see how that goes.

Meanwhile, I did manage to find some amusing things at the event. One of the posters prominently featured UT and The Daily Texan.

I also picked up a flyer that included a short description of a Singaporean student's previous exchange at Penn State. Some highlights:



	
  * Everyone talks about football all the time, even the girls.

	
  * Subjects such as basketball, photography, and horticulture are "obscure".

	
  * The best things about PSU: Football, hands-on experience with money, parties, and frat guys (???).

	
  * And last but not least: "The courses were a lot less demanding in terms of content" at Penn State. "Concepts taught were intuitive and there really were not a lot of math involved. Overall, I wouldn't say the quality of education is the highest or the most demanding." (This student took an art history class, a photography class, and a literature class. What did he expect?)


Now I really want to find a flyer about UT.

Random thought to end with: The buses here are pretty awesome. Why? They're huge, fancy, and air conditioned well. More importantly, they don't sound like jet engines nor do they cause permanent hearing loss when passing you by. I'm looking at you, Forty Acres shuttle.

[caption id="attachment_194" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Typical phone conversation on the Forty Acres: "Hey are you still there? It sounded like a tornado just ripped through campus." "Nah, that was just the bus.""][![](http://philiplebo.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/utshuttlejet.jpg?w=300)](http://philiplebo.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/utshuttlejet.jpg)[/caption]
