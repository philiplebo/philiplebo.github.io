Hi again. I know it's been awhile... it's been over two months since my last post. I'm back in Texas now, and it might be somewhat silly to be still updating my travel blog, but I'm doing it anyway. I'm still updating it partly because I don't really like the way I left things in my last post, partly because I like to use this blog as my own personal way of thinking back on my semester abroad, and partly because some part of me hopes that somebody still wants to hear my story.

Half of this post was actually written from 35,000 feet in the sky. I was 14 hours into my 28 hour trip back to Texas, and got a chance to type out a good part of my trip to Thailand. Unfortunately, by the time I was back home, I got so caught up with reverse culture shock (more on that later) that I completely neglected finishing this post up.

At the end of the semester, after classes ended but before exams began, we all had an entire week off of school. It's called "reading week" and is absolutely intended to be used as study time to prepare for exams. We, perhaps foolishly, decided to use that week to travel rather than study.

It started just like any of our other trips: with semi-panic and confusion between everyone that was going. Nobody was really sure where exactly we were going, how to get there, or how long we would spend in each place. It was far different than the plans we had elaborately laid out for Indonesia. We left on a Saturday morning to Phuket, Thailand's second largest airport and one of the major travel destinations in all of Southeast Asia.

Oh, and did I mention that I was sick? I was sick. Really sick. What first started as an annoying cough (and it was annoying... Judy yelled at me constantly because of it) turned into a pretty bad chest infection. The Thursday before our trip, after it was clear that it would not go away on its own, I went to the health clinic. As soon as I stepped up to the reception desk they gave me that “oh you look like hell” look. It only took about 15 minutes to see a doctor and get prescribed a boatload of medicine, and I got to wear this awesome mask while I waited! I felt like I was being quarantined.

I came very close to bailing on the trip, but the medicine started kicking in the night before our flight out. I still had to finish the course of antibiotics (drug resistance and all that...), but that could be done while I was in Thailand. The only downside: those antibiotics made everything taste like metal. Bummer for the Thai food.

But off we went! We landed at Phuket without much trouble, and after a little bit of confusion about what town we needed to go to we finally were able to hire a driver to take the five of us (Judy, Tin, Alison, Kelly, and myself) to Khao Sok National Park. The place we chose to stay at was a small guesthouse. Actually, it pretty much was just a small, dirty, creature-ridden cabin at the edge of a forest, but it had a mattress and a mosquito net and that's all we really needed.

It wasn't long after we stashed our packs into our room that the owner of the guesthouse offered to take us to ride elephants at a place nearby. I had heard things about elephant riding in Southeast Asia before, about how it was inhumane and cruel to the elephants. Everything I knew about them said that if you were going to ride elephants, you should find somewhere that had a good reputation for treating the animals well. We hadn't heard anything particularly bad about this place. We hadn't heard anything particularly good, either, but we had no other plans so we thought we would at least go and give it a look for ourselves.

After a bumpy ride in a beat up, rusty van (I think by this point we were all accustomed to less-than-luxurious methods of travel) we hopped out at the edge of a tree line where we saw a few elephants munching on banana leafs and tree trunks. The place looked alright, and the people running it were quite nice, so we hopped on a few elephants and off we went wandering through the jungle.

Riding elephants was nothing special. We had a good time, I suppose. We rode through some rivers, up some hills, and eventually ended up at a small waterfall. I named the elephant I was riding on "Ralph" despite Kelly's demands that "Ralph" was not an appropriate name for a girl. She was definitely a Ralph, though.

Riding elephants seems to be quite a big deal in Southeast Asia. It's a big tourist attraction, and many people see it as one of those "must-do" things while in Thailand or Indonesia. If someone were to ask for my opinion, though, I would say to avoid it. The entire thing is just degrading to the animals, even when it appears that they are treated fairly. Even at the place we were at, where the elephants seemed to be treated alright, I think all of us ended up walking away with a bad taste in our mouths. It wasn’t worth it in the slightest.

After we were done with the elephants it was getting quite dark, and as we found out quite quickly, there isn't much to do after it gets dark except to eat and sleep (sounds a lot like Garland, actually). We ate a small plate of noodles, nothing special but provided by our guesthouse for free, and called it a night.

The next day we signed up to go on a tour around the man-made lake located within the national park. Our day started with yet another long drive out to the lake, but this time our group was accompanied by a Canadian named Dan. It was nice to have someone to talk to during the drive, and before I knew it we were at the lake. The lake was created many decades ago by damming one of the major rivers that runs through southern Thailand. At first, the lake was nothing special, but once we hopped into a small long-tail boat and were heading towards the middle of the lake that quickly changed. Seeing the lake and the surrounding mountains was another one of those moments that took my breath away. You know the opening scene of the first Jurassic Park movie? The one where they fly the airplane through the mountains? Or the scene in Avatar where they fly through the floating mountains? That's as close as I can get to describing what the lake was like. Giant mountains, giant masses of rock, some with trees clinging to the sides, looked as if they were weightlessly floating on top of the water as we cruised around them.

We took the boat out to a small secluded cove that our tour guide said was good for swimming. The water felt fantastic, although it was a little strange whenever I looked down into the abyss of dark blue water. I had no idea how deep the water was and who knows what kind of creatures were staring right back up at me. There was a small outcropping on the side of the cove where we took turns climbing up and jumping off. Cue silly pictures.

After swimming for awhile, our boat driver took us farther up the river to a small group of huts floating in the middle of another, slightly larger cove. We kayaked around the lake for a bit while lunch was prepared, then chowed down on some of the most delicious green curry, pineapples, and watermelon I've ever tasted.

Our next stop on the lake was actually a small grove of trees on the shore. We didn't know it at the time, but our tour guide was about to take us on a multi-hour hike through the jungle. Most of us were wearing flip flops, and traversing the wet, muddy, and rocky ground was both difficult and dangerous. I was wearing my hiking sandals though, and for the first time felt very, very grateful that I bought them before I left Texas.

It seemed like we were hiking for an hour or more, but eventually we came across a stream of water and followed it to its source: a dark flooded cave. Usually, our guide told us, you could go in one end of the cave and follow the stream out the other end, somewhere else deep in the jungle. But because it had been raining a lot the days prior, the cave was almost entirely flooded and we could only go inside maybe 50 yards. It was cool, but we all got soaking wet and the water here, unlike the water in the lake, was freezing cold. Once we got back outside the cave we also found out that the water was home to leeches, several of which were feasting on our blood. I have a pretty strange looking scar on my foot from pulling one of them off of me.

The hike back was uneventful, though while our guide was hacking our way through the jungle with his machete, he cut down a stalk of bamboo and brought it back to the boat. He then cut it into smaller pieces and, right there in front of us, crafted each strand of bamboo into a bracelet for each of us. I'm not usually a guy to wear bracelets, but I have to say that it was pretty cool.

It got dark almost as soon as we left the lake, which again meant there wasn't much to do around the small town in which we were saying. We stumbled across a small restaurant where we ate and played cards to kill some time. At one point we looked over to find a local Thai man fire dancing in the middle of the bar. He was really good at it, but unfortunately it was impossible to get any good pictures or videos because of how fast he was slinging the torches around.

The next morning we almost immediately got on a minibus to take us to Krabi, a city to the south where we were to catch a ferry to Ko Phi Phi. It took most of the day to get to the island, but once we were there it was clear that we would have a good time. As far as beautiful beaches go, Ko Phi Phi ranks solidly within the top 3 that I've ever seen.

Ko Phi Phi is a very interesting island. It's extremely small, with a tiny town built mainly on the shoulders of tourism revenue. The town, and most of the island, was entirely destroyed by the 2004 Indonesian tsunami, and it shows. When we were there the town was still undergoing construction efforts to rebuild the infrastructure. Electricity and plumbing was little more than small plastic pipes running through the streets. Businesses were still in the process of rebuilding, and tsunami evacuation signs were posted at every corner.

Judy had booked a hostel at the island beforehand, so we spent a little bit walking around town looking for the right place. Though it might be small, the winding streets were very confusing at first. Once we got to our hostel, though, we found that the guy who ran the place, Champ, was one of the nicest people we had ever met. He immediately took us under his wing, showing us around town and recommending places for us to eat. It was already getting late, so we all ate a delicious plate of pad thai and then ran over to the beach to catch the sunset.

By the way, that was the first plate of actual pad thai that we had in Thailand. We were going for something a bit more authentic, so we chose a hole-in-the-wall place in hopes it would be better than the highly touristy Irish pubs and German bars that were all over town. And hole-in-the-wall it was. I think the most interesting characteristic of the place was who we were sharing our table with: cats. There were cats everywhere. I had to shoo a cat out of my chair so that I could sit down, at which point he and several other cats swarmed to lay at our feet under the table. There were cats on the countertop, in the kitchen, and on the tables. There was even a cat sleeping inside the refrigerator.

The next day Champ took us out on a long-tail boat for a snorkeling expedition around Ko Phi Phi Le, a smaller island nearby. We made a quick pitstop at a small beach that monkeys had apparently taken over. Tricky fellas kept trying to steal water bottles and food from everyone that was there. We didn't stick around long, though, because we had all seen plenty of monkeys on our other adventures through Southeast Asia. Pretty soon we were standing on Maya Beach, a strip of sand in the middle of a cove where the Leonardo DiCaprio movie _The Beach_ was filmed. It was a gorgeous place, or it used to be, before it became one of the main tourist attractions in the area. 30-40 boats and hundreds of people stood around on the beach as if there was something marvelous about it. I still find it strange that it's so popular, considering the fact that it seems most people don't even know about the movie until some tour guide tells you about it.

Finally we got around to snorkeling. The coral reefs weren't as beautiful as they were in Bali, but here we were able to see a lot cooler marine life. We saw several sea turtles just floating around looking for food. Occasionally they would swim up to the surface for some air before diving back down to the depths of the Andaman Sea in search of food. We also saw plenty of barracuda, jellyfish, and sharks. We saw a lot of sharks, actually. They were the smaller, not-so-dangerous reef sharks, so we weren’t in any real danger. They blended in with the color of the sea floor so we spent quite awhile floating silently in the water hoping to spot them. We ended up seeing more than 15 of them, which according to Champ, was more than he had ever seen. Guess we got lucky that day.

Later that afternoon, after showering and changing clothes, we decided to make the hike up to one of the several “viewing points” atop the hills overlooking the rest of the island. At first it didn’t really look like much of a climb, but about halfway up we realized we would need another shower once we got back to the hostel. By the time we reached the top I was completely drenched in sweat. The view was nice, though. We got some nice pictures, and from our vantage point you could see just how small the island was.

After showering and changing clothes for the second time, the sun had gone down and darkness had set across the island. We decided to see what kind of nightlife happened out on the beach. We had heard that it was quite crazy, but what we found far exceeded our expectations. The entire beach was lined with bars, each one blaring their own style of music (more AT40... can’t get away from it) and flashing strobe lights all over the place. There was jump rope, fire dancing, and tons of fireworks.

The next day we spent almost exclusively relaxing on the many different beaches across the island. It was one of those sit-and-do-nothing days that we all needed at this point. We swam, we tossed around beach balls, and I took a few naps on the beach. Pretty much the entire day was like that. Once nightfall came we said we were going to head back out to the beach, but we all ended up lying down in our beds in falling asleep pretty early. We had to catch a ferry the next day, so it was probably better that we went asleep when we did.

In the morning we did a bit of shopping to grab some souvenirs and shirts before we had to catch our ferry back to Phuket. Three hours of staring out into the big blue ocean later, we were back in Phuket Town. The plan was to stay in Phuket Town for one night so that we could see the town before catching our flight back to Singapore the next day. Once we checked into our hostel, we quickly found out that there really isn’t much to do in Phuket Town. We ate a few good meals, went to a mall and a small market, and that was pretty much it. If we had had more time, we might have been able to head to the famed Phuket beaches or hikes around the island, but I think we were all a little tired of beaches.

We were back in the welcoming arms of Singapore by nightfall that Saturday. I had a final exam for one of my classes on Tuesday, and I had hardly done any studying whatsoever. Time to hit the books.

_By the way, I'm still not done with the blog. I've still got Vietnam, Laos, and my return to the US to write about! More is coming!_
