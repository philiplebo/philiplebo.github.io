_I have to apologize for my terrible writing skills and complete disregard of grammar and syntax. These past few entries have been written at 3 or 4 in the morning while completely sleep deprived. I'm still experimenting with the blog. I've found that Wordpress makes it a pain to post decently formatted photos, hence the lack of many pictures. I might switch to something else if I can find a better blogging platform._

**Moving In**

University Town… how do I describe it? UTown is a brand new complex next to the university campus. It includes several residence buildings, several activity centers, several places to eat, and a whole lot more. It opened the week we moved in, making us the first people to ever live here, and only about half of it is complete. The complex itself is bigger than the entire Forty Acres, and the buildings are massive. Each residence hall (there are currently four, with two more under construction) is about as big as Jester Dormitory at UT. The complex is like something from the future. Everything has an ultra modern style, all of the door locks are RFID controlled, and there is more study/activity space than you can imagine. I live in the Graduate Residences along with hundreds of other exchange students.

My brand new room

The pictures of my apartment do not do it justice. It is, without a doubt, one of the nicest places I will live in for the next several years. And it is only costing about $2000 USD to live here for the entire semester. Unfortunately, the apartment doesn’t have air con, but it has plenty of windows and fans. It is comfortable as long as the windows stay open and there is good circulation.

After hanging around my apartment for a bit, Judy and I headed to an event for exchange students called The Amazing Race. It was basically a scavenger hunt around campus, but a lot more fun because we got to meet tons of other exchange students. Meeting people here is ridiculously easy. All it takes is a simple “Hi! I’m Philip from Texas, where are you from?” and you become instant friends. This event is where we first met Wonchi from Connecticut, Kelly from Vancouver, and many many others. (Keep track of the names! They’re going to be sticking around.)

Dancing to Jai Ho

Towards the end of the event, the facilitators gave everyone gift bags with small things like water bottles, brochures, and a map of the campus. Written on the bag said “Exchange Program 2008” on it. Weird. It also included a can of “Mackerel in Tomato Sauce.” We asked the locals to see if maybe it was some sort of S’porean dish or something. It wasn’t, and they had no idea why it was given to everyone. Weirder.

**Sentosa!**

After the race we heard rumor that a large group of the exchange students were going to Sentosa to hang out at the beach. Sentosa is a resort island off the coast of Singapore, and it is notorious for being a tourist hotspot. The entire island is known as Asia’s premiere resort hotspot. Everything is expensive and there are tons of fancy hotels, casinos, clubs, restaurants, etc. Universal Studios Singapore is also located on Sentosa. Before I ever came to Singapore I was warned that Sentosa is a fun place to go once to see the sights but that you will never want to go back because everything feels “fake”. We went anyway.

To get to Sentosa we had to take a train from a mall on the waterfront. This was our first experience of one of the major shopping malls in Singapore (of which there are many). It was crazy. Even at 10:00pm there were thousands and thousands of people running around, shopping at almost any store you can think of. We didn’t stick around much, though. We wanted to get to Sentosa.

We didn’t arrive until after dark, so I don’t have any pictures of the island. We plan to go back during the day and hang out on the beach, though. Despite being fake and manufactured like I had been warned, Sentosa was beautiful. We met up with a large group of 100 or more exchange students and hung out on the beach for several hours. The original plan was to go to a club on the beach, but the cover charge was $35 nobody was willing to pay it. We sat on the beach right outside the club where we could hear the music and see the lights anyway. It was much cheaper and much more fun. It was great to get a chance to know more of the exchange students, and provided much needed relaxation after a long day of running around.

**Texas, Our Texas **

At this point, almost a week after arriving in Singapore, I had met plenty of people from all over Asia, Europe, Australia, and even Africa. It was a little strange that I had only met two people from America, though.

Funny story about that. While walking back to UTown at 2 in the morning after our trip to Sentosa, we ran into a guy wheeling his luggage around the main plaza looking very lost. He had just arrived and was trying to check in to his residence, but the check in desk was closed.

Tin: “Do you need a place to stay for the night? You can sleep on my couch if you want.”

Me: “Yeah, it will be difficult to find somewhere to stay right now. You can definitely crash in one of our rooms for the night.”

Lost guy: “That would be awesome. Sorry, I’m Zack. Where are you from?”

Tin: “Valentine, from Croatia.”

Zack: “Cool. I’m from America.”

Me: “No way! We were just saying how we hadn’t met very many Americans. What state?”

Zack: “Texas.”

Me: “Me too! What school in Texas?”

Zack: “The University of Texas at Austin.”

Cue jaw dropping.

Zack also knew of another Longhorn studying in Singapore this semester, Will. Apparently UT decided to send 6 of us to Singapore and didn’t inform any of us that any fellow Longhorns would be here.

Zack crashed on my couch for the night. I offered one of the empty bedrooms to him so he could sleep on the bed, but he declined. He didn’t want to sleep on someone else’s bed. We woke up the next morning and I took him down to the check-in desk to see where he would be living. On the way, we joked at how funny it would be if we are roommates and the bed he refused to sleep on was actually his bed.

We are. It was.

**Suddenly, Durian**

We met up with Alison, Tin, Kelly and Wonchi to go shopping at Clementi Mall near the campus, but instead of shopping inside the mall we went to the much cheaper marketplace behind the mall. We had to buy pillows, bed sheets, and a few other random things for our rooms. The locals here are all so helpful and determined to get you exactly what you need. We also went to a hawker centre for something to eat. I tried Chicken Laksa, a soup with chili and coconut sauce. It was good, but spicy. Pretty much everything here is spicy.

We also tried durian. Durian is another one of those things that is just unexplainable. It is impossible to understand the taste and smell of durian without actually trying it in person. I think the closest description you can get is a mixture of gasoline, rotting onions, and various nuts. Some people love them, most people hate them. It's even against the law to carry durians with you in certain areas in Singapore, such as buses and trains, because of the pungent smell. Everyone except for Zack grabbed a small piece and popped it into our mouths. It was terrible. We finally convinced Zack to try it, and go figure, he loved it. He took the rest of the durian and ate it all, nearly causing the rest of us to throw up. We plan on holding it over him for the rest of the semester, “Remember when you didn’t want to try durian? Remember when you loved it?”

With that said, I’ve adopted a personal motto for this semester that goes something like “For the next four months you are not allowed to say ‘no’ to trying anything new unless it could kill you, and even then…”

It'll be fun.
