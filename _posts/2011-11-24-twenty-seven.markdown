I’m back from Thailand. It was another amazing trip. Amazing beaches, amazing jungles, and amazing people. But that’s not what this blog post is about. Thailand will come later, I promise. Right now there are other things to write about.

Exams have started. My first one was on Tuesday, and since I didn’t get back from Thailand until Saturday night, I only had two full days to study. Seeing as how I hadn’t even opened the textbook for this course yet, I really had to crack down and study. Over the course of two days, I read the entire textbook, wrote up a 14-page study guide, and reviewed more PowerPoint slides than I can count.

I suppose it paid off. I feel as though I did fairly well on the exam. Well enough that I’m not worried about my grade, at least. My next (and last) exam is on Monday, and I actually haven’t started studying for it yet, either. I’ve been busy.

On Tuesday after my exam I went downtown to meet up with a fellow UT student who is studying in Bangkok for the semester. Due to the major flooding in and around Bangkok, her classes were canceled for quite awhile and she had the opportunity to come visit Singapore! We had a great time catching up and sharing stories about our experiences abroad. We had some really interesting conversations about how this semester really has completely changed our lives. It was really an eye-opener for me, and made me realize just how difficult it is going to be to go back home and say goodbye to all of this.

**Goodbyes**

Today was a difficult day. Another one of my German roommates, Julian, left. He embarked on a trip through Vietnam and Laos before heading back to Germany. It’s extremely unlikely that I will see him again before I go back to Texas. Two of my other friends, Dina and Sveta from Russia, are leaving tomorrow for Vietnam. We went out to Arab Street and had a farewell dinner. We reminisced for a few hours about the past few months, but eventually we had to say our goodbyes. It’s hard to say goodbye to the people I’ve met here. They are some of the most amazing people I’ve ever met in my life. We explored, learned, and partied together through some of the craziest experiences we’ve ever had. And now we have to go our separate ways.

Goodbyes here are different than goodbyes back home. Don’t get me wrong, leaving Texas was difficult. I had to leave behind all of my family, friends, and pretty much my entire life, knowing I wouldn’t see any of them for the next 5 months. But see, that’s the difference. When I left Texas, I left knowing that I would be back. I knew that no matter how hard it was to say goodbye to everything, it would only be 5 short months until I was back in Texas eating Whataburger with my closest friends.

When we say goodbye here, we all tell each other that we’ll see each other again. We agree that one day, we’ll visit each other. Maybe we’ll have some sort of reunion back in Singapore, or we’ll all make the trip to Zagreb, or Vancouver, or meet up somewhere in Japan. It’s a comforting thought, but despite our words, in the back of our minds we all fully understand just how unlikely that is. We all know the price of a plane ticket. We all know how even the most well-laid plans can flip upside down at a moment’s notice. We don’t like to think about it, and we definitely don’t like to talk about it, but we all know that these last few weeks might be the last we’ll ever have together.

It’s hard. It’s really hard. Just typing out this paragraph is rough. And it’s only going to get harder over the next month.

**I Don’t Need Turkey to Be Thankful**

Today is Thanksgiving, I guess. There’s really no such holiday in Singapore. There are no big feasts, no turkey, no cranberry sauce, no pumpkin pie, and there’s certainly no football. I settled for a turkey sandwich from Subway instead of a normal Thanksgiving meal. There are still things to be thankful for, though.

So today, like every day, I am thankful for the amazing opportunities that I’ve had this semester. I’m thankful that even on the roughest days here, all it takes is a quick reminder that I am in Singapore living out my dreams, and everything is suddenly better. I’m thankful for my family, friends, and faith that have been there to encourage me and help me through this semester. I’m thankful for the things I’ve learned and the things I’ve seen. I’m thankful for the people I’ve met, for the friends I’ve made, and for the effect on my life that they’ve all had. I’m thankful that we’ll keep in touch.

And I’m thankful that, despite what I wrote earlier, someday we'll meet up again.

I started packing all of my things back into my suitcase today. I guess I should get back to doing that now.

My flight back to Texas is in 27 days.

Twenty seven.

What a terrifying number.
