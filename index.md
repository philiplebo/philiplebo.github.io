### Who I <span style="color: #0059ff">am</span>
I'm a technology consultant and developer that enjoys affecting change at large companies through creative use of analytical, technical, and communication skills. I'm known as the “bridge builder” between the technical and non-technical, helping companies to combine the best of both worlds to implement high quality solutions to challenging problems, especially those those requiring quick learning and adaptability. I'm an effective team lead and client relationship manager with both strong technical capabilities and interpersonal skills. I have extensive experience in information security and helping companies protect themselves from attackers.
